            <h1>Images</h1>
            <p>All images were exported and saved in jpg form with quality at 80% as the sixe was significantly smaller than png form.</p>
            <img src="./assets/breakfastfull.jpg" alt="Image 1" width="800"/>
            <p>For this image, I wanted to add some more fruit and veg to look more filling as the food looked light and
                <br> I did not want to give the impression of an unhealthy diet.  
                <br>I did that by choosing the clone brush tool and choosing the area that I wanted to clone to do so. 
                <br> However, the edges around the fruit were rough so I used the Erase Brush tool, reduced hardness to 0% so 
                <br>I could make the edges smoother. Also, Adjustment -> colour balance and on midtones increased red to 50% 
                <br> to get a warmer colour. This image was used in the contact page.  </p>
                <p><strong>Image 1</strong></p>

            <img src="./assets/jogging.jpg" alt="Image 2" width="800"/>
            <p><strong>Image 2 - size 1920px x 1280px 525.35Kb</strong></p>
            <p> This image was downloaded from pixabay. I wanted to improve brightness in this image and also 
                <br>I wanted to make the colours look more vibrant. In Affinity photo, I used the Adjustment option and 
                <br>then Brightness/Contrast. I changed from the default option to Increase Contrast and thenincreased 
                <br>Brightness by 13% and Contrast by 10%.  Exported this image in a jpeg form as it was significantly 
                <br> smaller than the png form (3.83 Mb) with quality at 80%.</p>

            <img src="./assets/beachyoga.jpg" alt="Image 3" width="800"/>
            <p><strong>Image 3 - size 4608px x 3456px, 2.39MB</strong></p>
            <p>For this image, I combined two photos together (Beach image and Yoga image) to get the desired result. 
                <br>Beach image: I worked on the noise in this image by choosing noise -> Denoise and I reduced luminance to 25%. 
                <br>As a result, colours look more lively and also quality looks better. In order to combine the two images,
                <br>I used Then in Affinity Photo and with the selection brush, I used the small size to select the girl practicing headstand,
                <br>then I chose 'refine' to check details, then select â€“ grow/shrink and I reduced it by 2 pixels. 
                <br> Then I created a mask layer, deselected the area I had selected and copy paste the photo on the beach photo.
                <br>I corrected the edges with erase brush tool and blended the colours with mimicing the ambient light. 
                <br> Furthermore, I dublicate the background layer and on the new background layer, 
                <br> I chose filters,then blur and then average blur and added this layer to the main layer. 
                <br> At last, I corrected the colour by using Curves in Adjustments and adjusted the colour to look warmer as this is a summer photo. </p>

            <img src="./assets/hivejump.jpg" alt="Image 4" width="800"/>
            <p><strong>Image 4 </strong></p>
            <p>Similar to image 3, I combined two photos (Jump image and Hive image) to get the desired image.
                <br> For the Jump photo, I used the selection brush tool and then I created a mask to refine edges and set the background as grid. 
                <br>Also, for combining the colours, I mimiced the ambient light of the hive photo by using the filters option and then Blur and Average. 
                </p>

            <img src="./assets/pool.jpg" alt="Image 5" width="800" />
            <p><strong>Image 5 </strong></p>
            <p>
            This image is a photo I took of some firends playing in the pool. Lighting is really challenging in this photo
            <br> and even though I knew that the quality of this photo would be poor, I still wanted to experiment and discover how much I could imporve it. 
            <br> Due to the low quality, I will not be using this image on the website. 
            <br> In order to edit this image, I create a copy of the original layer. Since haze was very strong in this image, 
            <br> I decided to reduce by using haze removal (filters -> Haze removal). Then I reduce distance as it created some dark shadows on the photo, 
            <br> reduced strength just a little and increased exposure correction a little as the photo was still dark. Moreover, Brightness still needed correction 
            <br> so I used the Lighting potion from filters and changed the light direction to expand from the top middle towards the centre of the photo. 
            <br> Also, I change the Shadows/Highlights filter by increasing to 50% the Shadows strength. 
            <br> Then, I increased the clarity by 50% for better details on the photo. 
            <br> Finally, I adjusted the colours by filters > colours > auto colours to make colours look more lively.  
            </p>
